# Credit-Risk-Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for performing comprehensive analysis on a credit risk dataset. The script covers data exploration, preprocessing, and model building using various machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features

Data Exploration: Analyzed data distribution, correlations, and missing values.

Preprocessing: Handled missing data, performed feature engineering using one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Model Building: Utilized Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers. Implemented GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Ensemble Model: Created a VotingClassifier ensemble of the best models for enhanced prediction.
